- However, citizen scientists have never disappeared, particularly in sciences such as archaeology, astronomy and natural history, where skill in observation can be more important than expensive equipment.

- Today, most citizen scientists work with professional counterparts on projects that have been specifically designed or adapted to give amateurs a role, either for the educational benefit of the volunteers themselves or for the benefit of the project. The best examples benefit both.

- Citizen scientists now participate in projects on climate change, invasive species, conservation biology, ecological restoration, water quality monitoring, popu- lation ecology and monitoring of all kinds. Three factors seem to be responsible for this great explosion of activity. 
	++ First is the existence of easily available technical tools for disseminating information about projects and gather- ing data from the public. Of course the internet is the most significant development, but mobile computing is playing a part too and will probably grow with the spread of smart phones. The usability of software is vitally important in helping volunteers take advantage of the information that is now potentially available to them.
	++ A second factor driving the growth of citizen science is the increasing realisation among professional scientists that the public represent a free source of labour, skills, computational power and even finance [4]. Large-scale environmental science requires citizen science.
	++ Third, citizen science is likely to benefit from the condition that research funders now impose upon every grantholder to undertake project-related science outreach. 

- The publications from this project [6â€“8] demonstrate that good science can, indeed often does, come from surveys that would probably never be approved by peer-review committees that demand rigorous tests of explicit hypotheses. Of course it helps such papers to emerge if the data collected by volunteer surveys are made freely available.

- The third category contains projects that provide the tools and resources that are now so abundantly available for citizen science. ...but to this list ought to be added all the generic resources that are available to aid collaboration on the web, but which are not specifically designed for science projects. Flickr, Facebook, Google maps, Twitter, iPod apps, YouTube, Wikis and other web 2.0 applications can all be used to reach and engage with a large audience.

Citizen Science: Can Volunteers Do Real Research? - Jeffrey P. Cohn

Topics
======
- Intro
- Science 2.0
- Reliability of data
- Monitoring montane taxa
- A new way to get involved

Quotes
======
- Collaborations between scientists and volunteers have the potential to broaden the scope of research and enhance the ability to collect scientific data. Interested members of the public may contribute valuable information as they learn about wildlife in their local communities.
