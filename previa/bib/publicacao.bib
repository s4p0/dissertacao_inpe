@article{Barlow2004,
abstract = {Over the past 20 years the combined effects of El Ni\~{n}o-induced droughts and land-use change have dramatically increased the frequency of fire in humid tropical forests. Despite the potential for rapid ecosystem alteration and the current prevalence of wildfire disturbance, the consequences of such fires for tropical forest biodiversity remain poorly understood. We provide a pan-tropical review of the current state of knowledge of these fires, and include data from a study in a seasonally dry terra firme forest of central Brazilian Amazonia. Overall, this study supports predictions that rates of tree mortality and changes in forest structure are strongly linked to burn severity. The potential consequences for biomass loss and carbon emissions are explored. Despite the paucity of data on faunal responses to tropical forest fires, some trends are becoming apparent; for example, large canopy frugivores and understorey insectivorous birds appear to be highly sensitive to changes in forest structure and composition during the first 3 years after fires. Finally, we appraise the management implications of fires and evaluate the viability of techniques and legislation that can be used to reduce forest flammability, prevent anthropogenic ignition sources from coming into contact with flammable forests and aid the post-fire recovery process.},

It considers the differences between scientists and other online groups? preferred modes of managing information production, circulation and application, distinguishing between ?constituted? and ?adaptive? authority and examining the extent to which these groups are engaged in curating the information they generate for the purposes of social problem solving. A small sample of crowdsourcing initiatives, drawn from the fields of astronomy and environmental science and crisis and emergency response, is examined based on desk research to illustrate the potential for boundary crossing between the domains of formal science and increasingly active loosely connected online groups which are engaged in activities giving rise to big data sets that may be ephemeral or may become constituted as ?useful knowledge?. The conclusion suggests several measures that would strengthen the foundations for collaboration and indicates avenues for further empirical research.},

@article{Brooks2006,
abstract = {The location of and threats to biodiversity are distributed unevenly, so prioritization is essential to minimize biodiversity loss. To address this need, biodiversity conservation organizations have proposed nine templates of global priorities over the past decade. Here, we review the concepts, methods, results, impacts, and challenges of these prioritizations of conservation practice within the theoretical irreplaceability/vulnerability framework of systematic conservation planning. Most of the templates prioritize highly irreplaceable regions; some are reactive (prioritizing high vulnerability), and others are proactive (prioritizing low vulnerability). We hope this synthesis improves understanding of these prioritization approaches and that it results in more efficient allocation of geographically flexible conservation funding.},

abstract = {Citizen science is becoming more valuable as a potential source of environmental data. Involving citizens in data col- lection has the added educational benefits of increased sci- entific awareness and local ownership of environmental con- cerns. However, a common concern among domain experts is the presumed lower quality of data submitted by volunteers. In this paper, we explore data quality assurance practices in River Watch, a community-based monitoring program in the Red River basin. We investigate how the participants in River Watch understand and prioritize data quality con- cerns. We found that data quality in River Watch is pri- marily maintained through universal adherence to standard operating procedures, but there remain areas where techno- logical intervention may help. We also found that rigorous data quality assurance practices appear to enhance rather than hinder the educational goals of the program. We draw implications for the design of quality assurance mechanisms for River Watch and other citizen science projects.},

About 95 percent of the forest cover was in natural forest and 5 percent in forest plantations Change in forest area deforestation 14.6 million ha year, 4.2\% loss of natural forest over 10 years. net reforestation, afforestation and natural expansion 5.2 million ha year, or 1.8\%. net change -9.4 million ha year. 2.4\% The majority of forest loss was in the tropics with a net change of -12.3 million ha in the tropics compared to +2.9 in the rest of the world Wood volume and above-ground woody biomass standing volume -386 billion cubic metres of wood above-ground woody biomass - 422 billion tonnes Forest plantations estimated 187 million hectares of plantations worldwide new forest plantation areas are being established at the reported rate of 4.5 million hectares per year Trees outside the forest - scarcity of information made it impossible to draw conclusions on the TOF resource Biological diversity - no new global data but new maps and detailed descriptions of forest ecological zones Areas under forest management - figure are based on country reporting without consistent levels of monitoring or standards. At least 123 million hectares of tropical forests 89\% of forest in industrialised countries Area of forests in protected areas - 12.4 percent of the worlds forests were estimated to be in protected areas (defined according to IUCN categories). Number and extent of forest fires - In those countries where long-term data are available, the evidence indicates an increase in wildfires in the 1990-2000 period compared with most of the previous decades in the second half of the twentieth century, although available records and qualitative assessments show that the 1980-1990 period may have been equally severe. The climate phenomenon known as El Ni\~{n}o was implicated as a major contributing factor. Wood supply and removals - estimated that 51 percent of world forests are within 10 km of major transportation infrastructure and potentially accessible for wood supply. 73\% within 40km. Highest in subtropical zones, lowest in boreal forests. Non-wood forest products - no global data available but some good regional and coutry analyses particularly for Asia.},

We developed a large-scale, high-resolution, automated remote-sensing analysis of selective logging in the top five timber-producing states of the Brazilian Amazon. Logged areas ranged from 12,075 to 19,823 square kilometers per year (±14\%) between 1999 and 2002, equivalent to 60 to 123\% of previously reported deforestation area. Up to 1200 square kilometers per year of logging were observed on conservation lands. Each year, 27 million to 50 million cubic meters of wood were extracted, and a gross flux of ?0.1 billion metric tons of carbon was destined for release to the atmosphere by logging.},

However, many of these species- and carbon-rich ecosystems have been destroyed by logging and conversion, which increasingly threaten protected areas. Our satellite, Geographic Information System, and field-based analyses show that from 1985 to 2001, Kalimantan's protected lowland forests declined by more than 56\% (>29,000 square kilometers). Even uninhabited frontier parks are logged to supply international markets. "Protected" forests have become increasingly isolated and deforested and their buffer zones degraded. Preserving the ecological integrity of Kalimantan's rainforests requires immediate transnational management.},

abstract = {Humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively in the last 50 years than in any comparable period of human history. We have done this to meet the growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber, and fuel. While changes to ecosystems have enhanced the well-being of billions of people, they have also caused a substantial and largely irreversible loss in diversity of life on Earth, and have strained the capacity of ecosystems to continue providing critical services.Among the findings: Approximately 60\% of the services that support life on Earth are being degraded or used unsustainably. The harmful consequences of this degradation could grow significantly worse in the next 50 years.Only four ecosystem services have been enhanced in the last 50 years: crops, livestock, aquaculture, and the sequestration of carbon.The capacity of ecosystems to neutralize pollutants, protect us from natural disasters, and control the outbreaks of pests and diseases is declining significantly.Terrestrial and freshwater systems are reaching the limits of their ability to absorb nitrogen.Harvesting of fish and other resources from coastal and marine systems is compromising their ability to deliver food in the future.Richly illustrated with maps and graphs, Current State and Trends presents an assessment of Earth's ability to provide twenty-four distinct services essential to human well-being. These include food, fiber, and other materials; the regulation of the climate and fresh water systems; underlying support systems such as nutrient cycling; and the fulfillment of cultural, spiritual, and aesthetic values. The volume pays particular attention to the current healthof key ecosystems, including inland waters, forests, oceans, croplands, and dryland systems, among others. It will be an indispensable reference for scientists, environmentalists, agency professionals, and students.},

abstract = {Every developer working with the Web needs to read this book. -- David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of the Rails framework RESTful Web Services finally provides a practical roadmap for constructing services that embrace the Web, instead of trying to route around it. -- Adam Trachtenberg, PHP author and EBay Web Services Evangelist You've built web sites that can be used by humans. But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages. This book puts the Web back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book:Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python) Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients  This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it. This book shows you how.},
