- However, citizen scientists have never disappeared, particularly in sciences such as archaeology, astronomy and natural history, where skill in observation can be more important than expensive equipment.

- Today, most citizen scientists work with professional counterparts on projects that have been specifically designed or adapted to give amateurs a role, either for the educational benefit of the volunteers themselves or for the benefit of the project. The best examples benefit both.

- Citizen scientists now participate in projects on climate change, invasive species, conservation biology, ecological restoration, water quality monitoring, popu- lation ecology and monitoring of all kinds. Three factors seem to be responsible for this great explosion of activity. 
	++ First is the existence of easily available technical tools for disseminating information about projects and gather- ing data from the public. Of course the internet is the most significant development, but mobile computing is playing a part too and will probably grow with the spread of smart phones. The usability of software is vitally important in helping volunteers take advantage of the information that is now potentially available to them.
	++ A second factor driving the growth of citizen science is the increasing realisation among professional scientists that the public represent a free source of labour, skills, computational power and even finance [4]. Large-scale environmental science requires citizen science.
	++ Third, citizen science is likely to benefit from the condition that research funders now impose upon every grantholder to undertake project-related science outreach. 

- The publications from this project [6–8] demonstrate that good science can, indeed often does, come from surveys that would probably never be approved by peer-review committees that demand rigorous tests of explicit hypotheses. Of course it helps such papers to emerge if the data collected by volunteer surveys are made freely available.

- The third category contains projects that provide the tools and resources that are now so abundantly available for citizen science. ...but to this list ought to be added all the generic resources that are available to aid collaboration on the web, but which are not specifically designed for science projects. Flickr, Facebook, Google maps, Twitter, iPod apps, YouTube, Wikis and other web 2.0 applications can all be used to reach and engage with a large audience.

- Collaborations between scientists and volunteers have the potential to broaden the scope of research and enhance the ability to collect scientific data. Interested members of the public may contribute valuable information as they learn about wildlife in their local communities.

- The term “citizen scientists” refers to volunteers who participate as field assistants in scientific studies. Citizen scientists help monitor wild animals and plants or other environmental markers, but they are not paid for their assistance, nor are they necessarily even scientists. Most are amateurs who volunteer to assist ecological research because they love the outdoors or are concerned about environmental trends and problems and want to do something about them. Typically, volunteers do not analyze data or write scientific papers, but they are essential to gathering the information on which studies are based. Citizen scientists represent “a partnership between volunteers and scientists to answer real-world questions,” states Rick Bonney, director of program development for Cornell University’s Laboratory

-- Cornell scientists who track citizen-science studies have so far found more than two hundred research projects being conducted by researchers in North America. Some observers think there may actually be thousands. Working with citizen scientists is “a growing worldwide phenomenon,” Shirk adds. “We’ve just begun to scratch the surface.”

-- “Citizen science is science 2.0,” Bonney says of how ecological studies are often done today. 

-- But why citizen scientists? Why depend on amateurs who may make mistakes, may not fully understand the context of the study, or may produce data that might be unreliable? Why not hire scientists, graduate students, and field technicians? One obvious reason is money. “We can’t afford them,” states Donald Owen, an environmental protection specialist with the National Park Service (NPS) in Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, speaking of professionals. “We can’t get enough research assistants to do what we can get volunteers to do. Not even close. The Appalachian Trail was built and is still maintained by volunteers. Using volunteers is the way the world works on the trail.”

-- Using volunteers also allows scientists to gather data on a larger geographic scale and over a longer time period than is possible in more traditional scientific research, adds Karen Oberhauser, assistant professor of wildlife and conservation biology at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul.

-- But can citizen scientists learn to use equipment, read results, and collect data that are as accurate, reliable, and usable as those generated by professional researchers? Yes, says Mitchell, “if we explain to them what they should be doing and how to do it. Nothing we’re doing is so difficult that volunteers can’t do it if they are properly trained.” Toward that end, the National Zoo’s McShea, for example, spent the better part of a day with his volunteers.

-- People who volunteer to participate in studies often are themselves scientists or science teachers and their students. Or they may be conservation group members or staffers, experienced bird-watchers, backpackers or hikers, or other outdoor enthusiasts. In other words, citizen scientists are typically people who care about the wild, feel at home in nature, and have at least some awareness of the scientific process.
